# Develop Generative AI Solutions in Azure

The exercises in this repo are designed to provide you with a hands-on learning experience in which you'll explore common tasks that developers perform when building generative AI solutions on Microsoft Azure.

> **Note**: To complete the exercises, you'll need an Azure subscription in which you have sufficient permissions and quota to provision the necessary Azure resources and generative AI models. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). There's a free trial option for new users that includes credits for the first 30 days.
